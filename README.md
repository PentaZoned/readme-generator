# readme-generator

This application generates a README.md by using user inputs, prompts, packages. There is no deployed link as this application is run within a terminal using `Node.js`. The user is able to view the generated README.md by opening them in a text editor such as VS Code.

The user can run the generator by using the command `node index.js`.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The user needs to install Node.js in order to utilize the commands to operate the application.
Instructions on how to install can be found here: [Installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installing

When the user clones the repository to their machine, they have to redirect themselves into the assets folder where there is the index.js and package.JSON, and they have to run the command `npm install` or `npm install inquirer`. The command `npm install` is appropriate because the package.JSON has `inquirer` listed as a dependency. After this, the application is all set to be run.
